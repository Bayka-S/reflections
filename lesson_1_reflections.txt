viewing a diff between two versions of a file helped me a lot
to find the typo that was in the file with significant less
amount of time as compared with the time i would have used
to look for the typo reading each and every single line 
in the file.

how could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

having access to the entire history would enable you  compare different versions of the file and help you see the mistakes u previously made
 and therefore avoid them in future.

 Manually choosing when to create a commit gives the programmer the advantage to create commits at any given time there is something to commit.

 the disadvantage of manual creation of commit is tha t a programmer 
 may forget to commit

 why do you think some version control systems , like git, allow saving multiple files in one commit while others , like google docs, treat each separately?

 git was designed to be used majorly by programmers

 How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files? 

 git log can show you all the changes that were made to different files whereas the git diff can show u the comparison of two commits showing the changes made. both what was added, removed and what remained unchanged

 How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
 using version control gives u the confidence because one is aware that even if he/she breaks something in the code he can always revert the changes to a point in time where the code was working.

 Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

 i want to use git to teach myself how to program and become a proffessional developer
